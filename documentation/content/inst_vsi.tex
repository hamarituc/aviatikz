The vertical speed indicator (or sometimes called variometer) shows the climb
and descend rates of an aircraft by measuring the derivative of the static
pressure. You can specify the vertical speed by the \texttt{vspeed} keyword
argument (ref. figure~\ref{fig:inst:vsi:basic}). Vertical speeds are specified
in \si{\feet\per\minute}. Since the variometer is a quite simple instrument
there are no further parameters.
